# Home folder structure
(This is supposed to be `tree`-like output but is obviously edited)
```
/home/username
|-- bin              = binary files, added to $PATH
|-- downloads        = default downloads folder
|-- tmp              = cleared at every boot, much like /tmp
`-- usr              = my "real" home
    |-- archive      = files rarely accessed
    |   |-- img      = images
    |   |-- ...      = a folder per programming language
    |   `-- template = templates like Makefiles and similar
    |-- doc          = documents
    |   |-- archive  = rarely accessed documents
    |   `-- ...      = a folder per section
    `-- src          = source code
        `-- ...      = a folder per programming language
